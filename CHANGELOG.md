# Changelog

## [3.2.2] - 2026-06-05

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Gradient bars now visible in dark/light themes**: Cost colour styles in both themes were mapped to plain white/black, making all three gradient segments look identical. Now uses distinct green/orange/red colours so the fill visually transitions as usage increases.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-06-05

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Windows compatibility**: Fixed blank screen on old Windows PowerShell caused by Rich `Panel` inside a `Live` display miscalculating terminal height. Header now uses `Rule` + `Text` which renders correctly on all terminals while keeping the same styled appearance.
